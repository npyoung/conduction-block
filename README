Moore, Joyner, Brill, Waxman, and Najar-Joa. (1978) Simulations of
conduction in uniform myelinated fibers: Relative sensitivity to
changes in nodal and internodal parameters.
Biophys. J. 21:147-160.

This model reproduces figures 2 and 3.
The standard temperature for the conductance Q10's is not specified
in the paper. However, fig 3 seems to give quantitatively similar results
when the choice for the "All Q10's" curve is a standard temperature of 0 degC.

The NEURON implementation of this model was prepared by Michael Hines.
Questions about details of this implementation should be addressed to him
at michael.hines@yale.edu.
